Inspiration

Answer the following questions would be worthy

1- Do Exploratory Data analysis to figure out which variables have a direct and clear impact on employee retention (i.e. whether they leave the company or continue to work).

2- Plot bar charts showing the impact of employee salaries on retention.

3- Plot bar charts showing a correlation between department and employee retention.

4- Now build a logistic regression model using variables that were narrowed down in step 1.

5- Measure the accuracy of the model.
